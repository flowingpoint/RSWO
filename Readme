Crafting recipies don't exist yet for the stones and runes of my minimal, they are a challenge if you like. Add them to your world by adding the folders 'stones' and  'runes' to your mod folder. 

The designing is best tested in the game's 'minimal' setting, another option on the main menu, it's the xyz icon at the bottom left. Play in singlenode - that's a seed option- , unless you know what you're doing.

There's another set of minetest game folders aside from the .minetest path and it's likely in /usr/share/games/minetest/games/ and when you find the 'minimal' folder, rename it and add this minimal in its place. (I recommend this because while tinkering I deliberately removed everything typical such as water sources and growing plants, mobs and furniture, etc. Just to focus.) There are 10 folders in this minimal and it is particularly the 'stones' folder that's world worthy, so check that out! 

You'll find it MUCH EASIER to build detailed or irregular structures with it, but it's far from perfect: I gave the game a month of steady questioning and found myself cutting a dodecahedron, a star shaped pin, and a special wall slab with indentations either side that produce a 5 pointed regular star in the negative space between them when a wall is made with them, a set of only three blocks which work together very nicely to make a spiral stone staircase such as you might see in an old castle, stone/grass divides for a municipal garden theme (Tired of right-angle-roads and square grass ditches, this was the first thing I thought should feature), and a few cuts that help the rocks of the world to sit well together. 

Feel free to change the names, add them to your mod, whatever.
Find me in the Czech server known as 'Tunneller's Abyss' where there's a bookshop called 'Jangle Books', where I 'rest my hat' from time to time and make potato chips.
