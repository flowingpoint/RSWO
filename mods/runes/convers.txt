[]"The shadows lengthen, but the path remains. What do you seek?"
[a]"I seek knowledge."
[a1]"Knowledge is a river. Some drink from it, others are swept away. Be wary of its currents."
[a1a]"I will be careful."
[a1a1]"Caution is the shield of the wise. Go now."
[b]"I seek nothing."
[b1]"To seek nothing is to find everything, and yet, you have found me. A paradox."
[b1a]"Indeed."
[b1a1]"The world is full of such beautiful contradictions. Farewell."
[b2]"Then click no further, little goblin, you're home and dry!"
[c]"Who are you?"
[c1]"I am the echo of the stone, the whisper of the world. I am what you make of me."
[c1a]"A strange answer."
[c1a1]"The truest answers often are. Until we speak again."
[c1a2]"Can you imagine a stranger one?"
[c1a3]"Yeah, I was just a water rune, but was crafted into this by use of a gem."
[c1b]"Is that so?"
[c1b1]"So it is, m'lad"
[c1b1a]"And are we speaking again now?"
[c1b1a1]"Maybe we're speaking, maybe we're typing, but words are going which way, and I'm poofed!"
[c1b1a2]"I wanna say no."
[c1b1a3]"We've a long way to go before you call that 'speaking'"
[c1b1b]"Is it really?"
[c1b1b1]"Yes."
[c1b2]"Aye aye cap'n."
[d]"I seek absolution"
[d1]"I seek absolution too! How about you tell me what you're doing so I can do it too!"
[d2]"Many's a fool goin down that road, partner, if'n they isn't got none to boot."
[d2a]"You should have led me the other way then, halfwit!"
[d2b]"I go it alone, buddy"
[d2b1]"Fool! Tracks lie cold in the rush of weaker ditherers, you must quickly read them and avoid the same end!"
[d2b2]"Then you're half as wise as I, who saw no rush for absolution!"
[d2b3]"That puts me on the road to obsoletion, hahaha. So what did you do to get here?"
[d2b3a]"A promise was broken, and I was the one to break it."
[d2b3b]"Is it one great misstep that brings a person here, or a thousand smaller ones?"
[d2b3b1]"Perhaps a single, profound error that echoed through time."
[d2b3b2]"A cumulative weight, a slow erosion of intent."
[d2b3b3]"It began with a tiny whisper of doubt, and here I am."
[d2b3c]"I told a dwarf his beard was splotchy and reccommended he give it a trim. It... escalated."
[d2b3c1]"You did not! You should offer something useful if giving a dwarf advice, like a razor, shampoo, or a mirror."
[d2b3c2]"That is a very personal thing to comment on in the dwarving community! You must have had a falling out after that!"
[d2b3c3]"A deliberate insult from a goblin, who of course does not grow beards unless in dwarven captivity, well I suppose you skipped town after that?"
[d2b3c3a]"I was locked in Master goblin Stax's toolshed and had to read books until them dwarves were able to forgive me."
[d2b3c3b]"I became known as 'the barber', and not in a good way. It was difficult to find a boat with that reputation."
[d2b3c3c]"No sooner had I spoken was I then taken to the dungeon. Hence this beard. It was easy to sneak out then."
[d2b3c3c1]"So the beard is a mark of your residual dwarven penance-magic. Are you going to keep it?"
[d2b3c3c2]"How did you cover up the green skin?"
[d2b3c3c3]"Did you learn anything in the dwarven dungeons?"
[d2b3c3c3a]"I got the whole layout in here *taps wrinkly forehead*"
[d2b3c3c3b]"I learned not to comment on a dwarf's beard, the hard way. It happened a few more times, and I was sent deeper and deeper..."
[d2b3c3c3c]"I overheard a guard saying Dwarf Dottimuck is plotting an uprising."
[d2b3c3c3c1]"Is that the dwarf who famously defended the goblins when they rebelled against Dwarf Spottysoot?"
[d2b3c3c3c2]"Should you be concerned at all about what the guard said? It could have been a double ditch booby bounty just to fool you."
[d2b3c3c3c2a]"There was only solemnity in his tone. War is coming for sure!"
[d2b3c3c3c2b]"I gave them nothing! Besides, Dottimuck is nowhere to be seen around here, why should I worry, even if it is true?"
[d2b3c3c3c2c]"I gave them very little. As far as I'm concerned, Dwarf Dotti is as finished as the Laws of Ley!"
[d2b3c3c3c2d]"I tried to ask around, but, you know, the beards... distracted me."
[d2b3c3c3c3]"No, I mean did you learn any mathematics?"
[d2c]"There's no easy way, is there?"
[d3]"Who are you?"
[e]"What path?"
[e1]"That path you take your time on, of course."
[e2]"The one you waste the whole day working on just to wind up where you started. Or am I wrong?"
[e3]"The path that will soon be submerged in darkness, my friend."
[e2a]"If I wind up at the start again it will not have been in vain."
[e2b]"It's no race to me, but it could be less work."
[e2c]"Then I had better get back before darkness falls!"
[e2b1]"It's no work at all if you know the return!"
[e2b2]"Is it too much for you? Would you like some pointers?"
[e2b3]"What are you building?"
[e2b3a]"A dialog path! This is [e2b3a] on the path!"
[e2b3b]"A little walkway around Stax's house."
[e2b3c]"A school"
[e2b3a1]"Indeed. A path of words can be a powerful thing. Where does it lead?"
[e2b3a2]"Fascinating. Is this path visible to others, or only to the mind's eye?"
[e2b3a3]"And what revelations do you hope to uncover on this dialog path?"
[e2b3a1a]"Perhaps to a deeper understanding of the self, or the intricate dance of thought."
[e2b3a1b]"It leads to new connections, new stories, and unforeseen destinations."
[e2b3a1c]"To the heart of the labyrinth, where all paths eventually converge."
[e2b3a2a]"It exists only within the architecture of thought, a private gallery."
[e2b3a2b]"It is a blueprint, waiting to be shared and built upon by others."
[e2b3a2c]"Its visibility depends on the clarity of the observer's own vision."
[e2b3b1]"It's a matter of serving yourself with choices at the end of the day!"
[e2b3b2]"It's a question of subtlety and speed, which will win?"
[e2b3b3]"A fine operation, for a goblin's servant, flowingpoint!"
[e2b3a2d]"Both, for it is a bridge between the inner and outer worlds."
[e2b3a2e]"It is a whisper that can only be heard by those who are listening."
[e2b3a2f]"It is a path etched in light, visible only when the sun is right."
[e2b3a2c1]"Then clarity is the key. How does one sharpen their vision?"
[e2b3a2c2]"A profound statement. So, the path reveals itself to the worthy."
[e2b3a2c3]"And what if the observer is blind to their own potential?"
[e2b3a2c1a]"By possessing choice, then moving with intention in a continuous way."
[e2b3a2c1b]"By knowing how a completed mission should feel"
[e2b3a2c1c]"By eliminating the unneccessary, until the essential reveals itself (quote from Bruce Lee)"
[e2b3a2c2a]"A worthy path should reveal itself to all who step onto it"
[e2b3a2c2b]"The worthy path might also be a 'wordy' path, no?"
[e2b3a2c2c]"Worthy of knowledge, or worthy of passage? There's a difference. You can know but not go, you can go but not know..."
[e2b3a2c3a]"The observer can promise to return"
[e2b3a2c3b]"If the path itself has potential to challenge the observer... I can build it with my own potential, for it would make me worthy of the build"
[e2b3a2c3c]"The observer is not blind to everything. The path is a free choice, and if not taken at all, there are others unseen."
[e2b2a]"For this game?"
[e2b2b]"For node construction?"
[e2b2c]"Its meant to be hard, but not impossible. Less is more."
[e2b2a1]"Yes, for this game we call tuk. It is a game of building, of weaving words into worlds."
[e2b2b1]"There are many steps. Would you like a walkthrough?"
[e2b2b1a]"Yes."
[e2b2b1b]"No."
[e2b2b1a1]"Basically draw it, label the vertices and faces, make a uv texture to map to, create an object file with a notepad that lists coordinates of vertices (right hannded coord system) uv mappings face normals and face definitions, and register the node in a lua file in some mod folder. A spreadsheet can help with animations. See [https://github.com/flowingpoint/Notes/blob/main/flowingpoints_koin_notes.pdf] for the journal I made while creating my very first dynamic placeable node."
[e2b2b1a1a]"OK"
[e2b2b1a1a1]"See [https://github.com/flowingpoint/Notes/blob/main/flowingpoints_koin_notes.pdf] for the journal I made while creating my very first dynamic placeable node."
[e2b2b1a1a1a]"OK"
[e2b2b1a1a1a1]"..."
[e2b2b1b1]"Dig it and dump it, order it in, smash it and crash it, throw in the bin."
